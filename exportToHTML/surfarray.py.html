<span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;pygame module for accessing surface pixel data using array interfaces 
 
Functions to convert pixel data between pygame Surfaces and arrays. This 
module will only be functional when pygame can use the external Numpy or 
Numeric packages. 
 
Every pixel is stored as a single integer value to represent the red, 
green, and blue colors. The 8bit images use a value that looks into a 
colormap. Pixels with higher depth use a bit packing process to place 
three or four values into a single number. 
 
The arrays are indexed by the X axis first, followed by the Y 
axis. Arrays that treat the pixels as a single integer are referred to 
as 2D arrays. This module can also separate the red, green, and blue 
color values into separate indices. These types of arrays are referred 
to as 3D arrays, and the last index is 0 for red, 1 for green, and 2 for 
blue. 
 
Supported array types are 
 
  numpy 
  numeric (deprecated; will be removed in Pygame 1.9.3.) 
 
The default will be numpy, if installed. Otherwise, Numeric will be set 
as default if installed, and a deprecation warning will be issued. If 
neither numpy nor Numeric are installed, the module will raise an 
ImportError. 
 
The array type to use can be changed at runtime using the use_arraytype() 
method, which requires one of the above types as string. 
 
Note: numpy and Numeric are not completely compatible. Certain array 
manipulations, which work for one type, might behave differently or even 
completely break for the other. 
 
Additionally, in contrast to Numeric, numpy does use unsigned 16-bit 
integers. Images with 16-bit data will be treated as unsigned 
integers. Numeric instead uses signed integers for the representation, 
which is important to keep in mind, if you use the module's functions 
and wonder about the values.

    Blit directly from a array values. 
 
    Directly copy values from an array into a Surface. This is faster than 
    converting the array into a Surface and blitting. The array must be the 
    same dimensions as the Surface and will completely replace all pixel 
    values. Only integer, ascii character and record arrays are accepted. 
 
    This function will temporarily lock the Surface as the new values are 
    copied.

    Copy pixels into a 2d array. 
 
    Copy the pixels from a Surface into a 2D array. The bit depth of the 
    surface will control the size of the integer values, and will work 
    for any type of pixel format. 
 
    This function will temporarily lock the Surface as pixels are copied

    Create a new 2D array that directly references the pixel values in a 
    Surface. Any changes to the array will affect the pixels in the 
    Surface. This is a fast operation since no data is copied. 
 
    Pixels from a 24-bit Surface cannot be referenced, but all other 
    Surface bit depths can.

    Create a new 3D array that directly references the pixel values in a 
    Surface. Any changes to the array will affect the pixels in the 
    Surface. This is a fast operation since no data is copied. 
 
    This will only work on Surfaces that have 24-bit or 32-bit

    Copy pixel alphas into a 2d array. 
 
    Copy the pixel alpha values (degree of transparency) from a Surface 
    into a 2D array. This will work for any type of Surface 
    format. Surfaces without a pixel alpha will return an array with all 
    opaque values.

    affect the pixels in the Surface. This is a fast operation since no

    Copy the colorkey values into a 2d array. 
 
    Create a new array with the colorkey transparency value from each
