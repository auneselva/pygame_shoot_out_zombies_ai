<span class="s2">Simple game made as a uni project with basic AI behaviors implemented </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">seek, wander, flee, pursuit, flee, evade, hide, avoid round obstacles, avoid walls, group attack</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">based on Mat Buckland's book </span><span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s2">Programming Game AI by Example</span><span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s2">.</span>

<span class="s2">You are steering your rocket. Your task is to shoot out all the enemies represented by red circles. You can also collect coins to gain score. Physical contact with enemies makes you die.</span>

<span class="s3">***</span>
<span class="s2">RUNNING THE GAME</span>

<span class="s2">Double-click on run.py file.</span>

<span class="s2">You can also import project to PyCharm IDE. Once your project is open, go to File-</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s2">Settings-</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s2">Project-</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s2">Python Interpreter. You have to set correct Python Interpreter to python 3.9. If you don't have python 3.9 on your computer, you have to first download it from its official website and run. After you set the Python Interpreter, add following modules</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">pip, pygame and setuptools. Then run the run.py file in the editor.</span>
<span class="s3">***</span>

<span class="s2">Currently, the behavior of enemies is set to Example mix 2 - it is switching in few seconds long intervals - hiding, fleeing and wandering with avoiding walls and obstacles. You can check how a single behavior works by uncommenting a given line of code from run.py file </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">lines 68 - 75</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">and running the game.</span>
